 * Plays a soft fade-up on each page section (and the footer) the first time it scrolls into view.
 * Only sections that start below the screen are animated, so nothing visible on load ever blinks;
 * the server HTML is left untouched (no hidden state without JavaScript) and reduced motion skips it.
 * Sections are hidden by a paused animation, never by a style attribute, so a section that React has
 * not hydrated yet never differs from its server HTML.
